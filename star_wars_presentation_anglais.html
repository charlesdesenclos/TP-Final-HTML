                    <p>Star Wars is a science fiction universe created by George Lucas. First conceived as a cinematographic trilogy released between 1977 and 1983, the saga then grew, between 1999 and 2005, by three new films, which recount events prior
                        to the first trilogy. This last one as well as the second trilogy known as “Prélogie” knows an immense commercial success and a generally positive critical reception. For the sake of consistency, and to achieve a result that he
                        had not been able to obtain from the start, the creator of the saga is also reworking the films of his first trilogy, released in 1997 and 2004 in new versions.
                    </p>

                    <p>The copyrights of Star Wars are bought in 2012 by the Walt Disney Company for 4.05 billion dollars: the theatrical release of the seventh episode of the saga and first of the third trilogy (episodes VII, VIII and IX) is then planned
                        for 2015. The Force Awakens became the franchise's biggest commercial success within a month. It is followed by The Last Jedi in 2017 and The Rise of Skywalker in 2019. In addition, Disney and the production company Lucasfilm inaugurate
                        in 2016 a series of derivative films grouped under the acronym A Star Wars Story, with the release of Rogue One whose events take place just before Episode IV. If Disney announces in May 2019 new films that will not belong to the
                        saga of the Skywalker family, the studio is putting their development on hiatus after the mixed reception of the latest opuses. The franchise then turns to the Disney + streaming platform, launched in November 2019 with the series
                        The Mandalorian, preceding other series featuring film or animated characters, such as Ahsoka.
